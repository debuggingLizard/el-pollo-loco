        <p><strong>Disclaimer of liability:</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Liability for content</strong><br><br>
            The content of our website has been compiled with the utmost care. However, we cannot accept any liability
            for the accuracy, completeness and topicality of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for
            our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 Para. 1 DDG and general legislation. However,
            according to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, as a service provider we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored
            third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to
            remove or block the use of information in accordance with general legislation remain unaffected by this.
            However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement.
            As soon as we become aware of such infringements, we will remove this content immediately.<br><br>
            <strong>Liability for links</strong><br><br>
            Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence.
            Therefore, we cannot accept any liability for this third-party content. The respective provider or operator
            of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for
            possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of
            linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete
            evidence of an infringement. If we become aware of any legal infringements, we will remove such links
            immediately.<br><br>
            <strong>Copyright</strong><br><br>
            The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law.
            Reproduction, editing, distribution and any kind of utilisation outside the limits of copyright law require
            the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only

            such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. If we
            become aware of any infringements, we will remove such content immediately.<br><br>
